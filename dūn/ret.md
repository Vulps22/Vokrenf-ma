## History
- ret may have originally been called ren. After the creation of the Vokrenfōma repository it was discovered that the dūn "ren" doesn't actually exist. But given the position of "ren" in the language's name, and the similarity to "ret", it is possible that the use of the word "ret" today is a mere spelling mistake that appeared early in the language's evolution.
