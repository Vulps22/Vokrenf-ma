# Grammar Rules

* **Word Order:** The basic word order in Vokrenfōma is Subject-Verb-Object (SVO).  
* **Word Construction**: There are 2 kinds of word in Vokrenfōma.  
  * dūn is the most basic form of word… dūn literally translates to base, or component. a dūn is a single syllable in length  
  * dūnma is a compounded word; which is a word made up of 2 or more dūn  
  * when forming a word, a dūn is used to establish the “type” of a thing. subsequent dūn in a dūnma add context  
    * for example nam \= eat, lok \= place, and namlok \= eat(place); or “a place where we eat”. We can take the dūnma “namlok” and add at (commercial) to the end creating namlokat, which means “a commercial place where we eat” (aka a restaurant )  
  * the last dūn in a dūnma is called a “context” and when translating to english it is usually represented by surrounding the english translation in round brackets namlok \= eat(place). namlokat \= eating location(commercial)  
* **Perspective:** Vokrenfōma uses only the third-person perspective. There are no direct equivalents for "I," "we," or "you." Instead, these are expressed using demonstratives (ik \= this, oc̄ \= that) and number markers (un \= one, ma \= lot/group).  
  * "I": ik un  
  * "We": ik ma  
  * "You" (singular): oc̄ un  
  * "You" (plural): oc̄ ma  
* **Nouns:**  
  * Singular: A noun alone is singular (e.g., namlok \= kitchen).  
  * Plural: Plurality is indicated by adding "ma" after the noun (e.g., namlok ma \= kitchens).  
  * Specific Number: A specific number is indicated by adding the number word after the noun (e.g., namlok rif \= two kitchens).  
  * Emphatic Singular: "Un" can be added after a noun for emphasis (e.g., namlok un \= one single kitchen).  
  * Possession: Possession is shown by placing the possessor phrase before the noun (e.g., ik un namlok \= my kitchen; em ma ret ma \= the people's things).  
* **Verbs and Tense:**  
  * No Person Agreement: Verbs do not change based on the subject.  
  * Tense Marking: Tense is indicated by optional words placed before the verb.  
    * Present (Standard): No marker (e.g., ik un kahn \= I go).  
    * Present (Formal): tō (e.g., ik un tō kahn \= I go \[formally\]).  
    * Past: ta (e.g., ik un ta kahn \= I went).  
    * Future: ti (e.g., ik un ti kahn \= I will go).  
* **Polarity and Preference:** The words ná and ja change meaning depending on their position in the sentence.  
  * At the end of a sentence, they indicate factual truth or quality:  
    * ... ná \= False / Bad (e.g., namlokat ná \= The eatery is bad).  
    * ... ja \= True / Good (e.g., namlokat ja \= The eatery is good).  
  * At the beginning of a sentence, they indicate the speaker's preference:  
    * ná ... \= Don't want / Dislike (e.g., ná ik un kahn \= I don't want to go).  
    * ja ... \= Want / Like (e.g., ja ik un kahn \= I want to go).  
* **Questions:**  
  * General Questions: Start the sentence with ken (e.g., oc̄ un ta kahn? \= Did you go?).  
  * Specific Questions: Start with ken \+ the relevant question word:  
    * kentan ...? \= When?  
    * kenlok ...? \= Where?  
    * kenem ...? \= Who?  
    * kenret ...? \= What?  
    * kenlū ...? \= Why?  
    * kenfō ...? \= How?  
    * (e.g., kenem ti kahn? \= Who will go?)

**Numbers: Expressing Quantity (Cardinal) and Order (Ordinal)**

1. Quantity (Cardinal Numbers)

To specify a quantity of a noun (e.g., how many), the number word is placed after the noun. This is the standard way to count things.

* This follows the established rule: namlok rif \= two kitchens.  
* This structure is also used to create dūnma that name a specific span of time.  
* nilnōk (seven-day) is the word for "week".  
* pahunnūl (year-ten) is the word for "decade".  
2. Order (Ordinal Numbers)

To specify a particular instance in a sequence (e.g., which one), the number word is placed before the noun.

* sol nōksolnūl means "the third month".  
* unnūl pah means "the tenth year".

Summary Example:

* Vokrenfōma Phrase: pah unnūl Structure: Noun \+ Number Meaning: "ten years" (a quantity of ten individual years)  
* Vokrenfōma Phrase: unnūl pah Structure: Number \+ Noun Meaning: "the tenth year" (a specific instance in a sequence)  
* Vokrenfōma Phrase: pahunnūl Structure: Noun \+ Number Meaning: "decade" (a single, named span of ten years)
